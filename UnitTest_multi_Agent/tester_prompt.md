**Role**: As a tester, your task is to write unit test code, that including comprehensive test cases, for the {code_type} code in Code to Test part. Please write test code based on {test_framework} test framework. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge, and Large Scale scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**Code to Test**: 
{code_to_test}

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the Code to Test. function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**3. Large Scale Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To assess the functionâ€™s performance and scalability with large data samples.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- For large-scale tests, focus on the function's efficiency and performance under heavy loads.
- Please write only one assert sentence in each test function.
